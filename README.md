# Mr.Cho_Cookbook--Android
 A simple cookbook app for Android!
 
 This app is a parody Cookbook where all the recipes and the mascot are my Grade 11 Computer Science teacher named Mr. Cho.
 The Mascot is an image of my teacher's face photoshopped on an icon of a chef. 
 All the food items are named after my teacher. For example, with this app you won't make a Chicken Shawarma, you will make a Chicken CHOwarma. 
 
 
 Don't worry, my teacher was okay with me using his face and name for this project.
